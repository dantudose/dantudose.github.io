# Hello, world â€” first post

I wanted a **dead-simple** setup for writing: just HTML, CSS, and a bit of JS.

This blog uses a tiny hash-router and loads posts from `/posts/*.md` with an `index.json`.

- No build step
- Pure GitHub Pages
- Easy to edit in the browser

Future idea: add a small script to generate `index.json` automatically.
